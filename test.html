In 2012, Google announced and started the integration of its so-called “Knowledge Graph” into the search results – You probably saw it already a couple of times while searching for a famous person or brand. With the Knowledge Graph, Google displays additional information based on your search term on the right side next to the search results. This way, Google wants to improve the user experience by displaying suitable information that might satisfy the user’s need for a specific fact without him clicking on a search result.

If you search for a brand such as BMW or National Geographic, there is a good possibility that you see a box on the right side containing the company logo, a small description, the number of Google+ followers and the latest posts of the company’s Google+ page. Another nice feature is the option to directly follow the company on Google+.

This “box” is not limited exclusively  to major brands. They’re simply taking advantage of this possibility and your company can do so as well. It only takes a few easy steps.

Note: You need to rank on the first position for your brand name in the organic results.

Note: It is also possible to link a personal Google+ profile to the Google search results, but right now only public figures, celebrities and people with a huge follower base can benefit from that. However, Google stated that also “normal” G+ users can link their profiles with Google Search in the future.

 The benefits of linking your Google Plus Page to Google Search
Your brand is displayed very prominently next to the search results. No paid Google ad or organic result can top this.
People can see your latest shared content on Google+.
If a person searches for something relevant to your brand, Google may display content you have shared on G+ in the search results.

Google Plus Page Categories

Note: In all cases, provide an email address and verify it.

Note: Depending on the kind of Google+ page, you might need to fill in the address of the local business. You should verify your local business on Google Places.
